            <h2>Tips & tricks</h2>

            <h3>Mind Your Wellness</h3>

            <ul>

                <li>Use Safe Spaces: If you ever feel overwhelmed, utilize the designated safe spaces for a break. They’re there to help you recharge in a quieter environment.</li>

                <li>Pace Yourself: It’s a marathon, not a sprint. Enjoy the festival atmosphere without overexerting yourself early in the day.</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>Be Mindful of Others</h3>

            <ul>

                <li>Consent and Personal Space: Always respect personal boundaries and ask for consent if you're interacting in ways that might affect someone else.</li>

                <li>Respect the Space: Keep the festival clean by using trash and recycling bins. Be mindful of your environment and the people around you.</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>Stay Connected</h3>

            <ul>

                <li>Designate Meetup Points: Mobile service can be spotty at festivals, so set up specific times and places to meet with friends if you get separated.</li>

                <li>Portable Chargers: Keep your phone charged for photos, schedules, and in case you need to get in touch with someone. There will be charging stations but we cannot guarantee they will be able to accomodate everyone's need so come prepared.</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>Stay Hydrated and Nourished</h3>

            <ul>

                <li>Hydration Stations: Make use of hydration stations if available. Staying hydrated is key, especially if it’s warm or you’re dancing a lot.</li>

                <li>Food Options: Explore different food vendors to keep your energy up throughout the day. Eating regular meals or snacks can prevent dips in energy and help regulate emotions and anxiety.</li>
